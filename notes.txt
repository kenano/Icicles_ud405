------------------
- Set up classes for:
	- Constants
	- DifficultyScreen should implement Screen.make sure to add methods to be implemented.
	- Player
	- Icicles
	- IciclesScreen, should implement Screen, make sure to add methods to be implemented.
	- Icicle
- Change default code created in IciclesGame.
    - change parent class being extended from ApplicationAdapter to Game.
    - remove render method and code inside create().
- add log tags to classes.
------------------
Define constants
	- Color for background, icicle.
	- size of world
	- size of icicle.
- Implement Icicle
	- member variables: vector for position
	- constructor parameter: position, sets position
	- implement render method
		- setColor
		- user shaperender to draw icicle.
- Implement IciclesScreen
	- member variables: shaperender, icicle, extendedviewport
	- Override show()
		- create shaperender
		- setAutoShapeType(true)
		- Create a new Icicle in the middle of the world
	- Override render
		- clear the background
		- Set the ShapeRenderer's projection matrix
		- Draw the Icicle
	- override resize
		- Ensure that the viewport updates correctly
	- override dispose
		- dispose of shaperender
-------------------
Create a class for the player
	- define contstants to draw player.
	- set up player class, add position vector, viewport member variables.
	-  Add constructor that accepts and sets the viewport, then calls init()
	-  Add init() function that moves the character to the bottom center of the screen
	- Create a render function that accepts ShapeRenderer and does the  drawing
	- add player to the IcicleScreen class.
		- add instance variable for player
		- initialize it in show()
		- call player.render in render
		- Reset the player (using init())
--------------------
Add keyboard input/movement.
	- add a member variable to store the velocity
	- instantiate this in init.
	- add a constant for the player speed. the velocity of the player is calculated by using this as a factor.
	- add method update to player which updates the position of the player based on input.
	-  Use Gdx.input.isKeyPressed() to move the player in the appropriate direction when an arrow key is pressed
	- add function to ensure the player is within the viewport
	- Call update() on player in IciclesScreen
